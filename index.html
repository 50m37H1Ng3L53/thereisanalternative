                        There is an alternative is a digital safe space 
                        for people to express their frustration with the 
                        current state of the world and the economy we live
                        in through stories from their workplace. Be it a 
                        server job at a restaurant, corporate (junior) 
                        position, office clerk, artist, factory worker 
                        - a lot of us have stories that reflect outdated 
                        corporate structures, bad internal communication, 
                        nonsense hierarchies, crazy bosses, managers, coworkers, 
                        clients, customers, etcetera. How do these experiences 
                        reflect on our daily lives, decisions, experience, health?
                        <br><br>The idea started from own experience and those 
                        shared by friends, mostly working in HORECA (Hotels, Restaurants, Cafes). 
                        It was born from desire, driven by frustration, aiming to start 
                        a dialogue, and, hopefully, enforce some long overdue changes. 
                        As opposed to Thatcher’s gaslighting TINA (There is no alternative), 
                        claiming that there is no other viable system than capitalism, 
                        TIA offers a space that encourages alternatives and doesn’t 
                        dismiss them as naive or foolish. To think of an alternative 
                        that benefits most (decent life above poverty line) as naive 
                        - isn’t it an act performed by those who don’t benefit 
                        from these changes? Or those who can’t afford to even 
                        begin to believe life can get better? How does one 
                        drop their privilege if it benefits their living standard? 
                        How does one question the system that holds its foot on their neck? 
                        To think that the necessary societal changes that 
                        directly affect our ways of living are naïve, 
                        dismiss them as impossible, and carry on living 
                        in current reality, is just another act of 
                        participation in the capitalist charades.
